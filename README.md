# ActiveCSV

## Goal

Work with some advanced Ruby topics such as `method_missing`, `respond_to_missing?`, modules and class-level instance 
variables, and review topics such as object equality and class methods.

## Setup

* Choose a pair you haven't worked with before
* Fork and clone this repo
* Add your pair as a collaborator to the repo
* Import the tracker stories in `stories.csv` into tracker
* Add instructors to the tracker project

When your code is done, run `rake csv` to generate sample data to test your code against.
